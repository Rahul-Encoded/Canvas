## Animating a Circle

This example demonstrates how to animate a single circle bouncing around the canvas.

- **Description**: A single circle moves around the canvas, bouncing off the edges.
- **Key Concepts**: Canvas setup, drawing shapes, animation loop, edge collision detection.

## Animating Multiple Circles

This example demonstrates how to animate multiple circles bouncing around the canvas.

- **Description**: Multiple circles move around the canvas, bouncing off the edges.
- **Key Concepts**: Arrays, object-oriented programming, multiple object animation.

## Interacting with Canvas

This example demonstrates how to add interactivity to the canvas animation.

- **Description**: Circles respond to mouse movements, changing size and color.
- **Key Concepts**: Event listeners, mouse interaction, dynamic property changes.

## Gravity Simulation

This example demonstrates how to simulate gravity with animated balls.

- **Description**: Balls bounce and interact with gravity, simulating a realistic physics environment.
- **Key Concepts**: Gravity, elasticity, friction, physics simulation.

## Collision Detection

This example demonstrates how to detect collisions between two circles.

- **Description**: Two circles detect collisions and change color when they overlap.
- **Key Concepts**: Distance calculation, collision detection, color change on collision.

## Particle Collisions

This example demonstrates how to simulate particle collisions with interactivity.

- **Description**: Particles interact with each other and respond to mouse movements, simulating realistic collisions.
- **Key Concepts**: Particle system, collision resolution, mouse interaction, physics simulation.

## Getting Started

To run any of the examples, simply open the corresponding HTML file in your web browser. Each example includes an HTML file that sets up the canvas and links to the JavaScript file.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.
