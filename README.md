## ⭕ Animating a Circle

This example demonstrates how to animate a single circle bouncing around the canvas.

-   **📝 Description**: A single circle moves around the canvas, bouncing off the edges.
-   **💡 Key Concepts**: Canvas setup, drawing shapes, animation loop, edge collision detection.

## ⭕⭕⭕ Animating Multiple Circles

This example demonstrates how to animate multiple circles bouncing around the canvas.

-   **📝 Description**: Multiple circles move around the canvas, bouncing off the edges.
-   **💡 Key Concepts**: Arrays, object-oriented programming, multiple object animation.

## 🖱️ Interacting with Canvas

This example demonstrates how to add interactivity to the canvas animation.

-   **📝 Description**: Circles respond to mouse movements, changing size and color.
-   **💡 Key Concepts**: Event listeners, mouse interaction, dynamic property changes.

## 🌎 Gravity Simulation

This example demonstrates how to simulate gravity with animated balls.

-   **📝 Description**: Balls bounce and interact with gravity, simulating a realistic physics environment.
-   **💡 Key Concepts**: Gravity, elasticity, friction, physics simulation.

## 💥 Collision Detection

This example demonstrates how to detect collisions between two circles.

-   **📝 Description**: Two circles detect collisions and change color when they overlap.
-   **💡 Key Concepts**: Distance calculation, collision detection, color change on collision.

## ⚛️ Particle Collisions

This example demonstrates how to simulate particle collisions with interactivity.

-   **📝 Description**: Particles interact with each other and respond to mouse movements, simulating realistic collisions.
-   **💡 Key Concepts**: Particle system, collision resolution, mouse interaction, physics simulation.
